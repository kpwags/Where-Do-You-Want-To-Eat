# WHERE DO YOU WANT TO EAT

**As of November 2019, Where Do You Want to Eat is No Longer Being Developed**

Due to Google API changes and costs to use the Geolocation API, I have decided to sunset this project.

This project was a little tool to decide where to eat without having to actually decide.

### How do I get set up?

- Place the files in the web directory
- Put your Google API key at the bottom of index.html where it says GOOGLE_API_KEY
